| * f127ddf  Use StringBuilder.Capacity to specify the available buffer size in OpenGL interop (StringBuilder.Length is invalid in this case). Added workaround for Mono 1.9.1 issue, where StringBuilder return truncated results when used in interop. Doubling the StringBuilder capacity fixes this issue. (4 years, 4 months ago) <the_fiddler>

| * 3462e80  Moved OpenTK.Graphics.GL class to the OpenTK.Graphics.OpenGL namespace (reason: necessary for OpenGL|ES support; necessary for support of different OpenGL profiles). OpenTK.Graphics.GL has been moved to the OpenTK.Compatibility library. Removed OpenTK.Graphics.Glu class (reason: deprecated upstream; most functionality provided by OpenTK math; not compatible with OpenGL 3.0+.) OpenTK.Graphics.Glu can be accessed through OpenTK.Compatibility. Added OpenGL|ES-specific ErrorHelper classes. Moved OpenTK.Graphics.DisplayDevice and OpenTK.Graphics.DisplayResolution to the root OpenTK namespace (reason: their functionality is not specific and does not depend on OpenTK.Graphics).

| * 81b06b8  Ensure Wgl core entry points are loaded prior to first use, even without a Wgl context. Do not query actual GraphicsMode.Default in DummyGLContext constructor. Doing so creates a temporary context, which should not be done when creating a dummy context. Fixed issue [#993]: "Possible bug in GraphicsContext.CreateDummyContext()". (4 years, 6 months ago) <the_fiddler>
| * 93b950e  Bumped version number. (4 years, 6 months ago) <the_fiddler>

| * 3ec5303  Added support for enum overrides. Enabled enum overrides in the CL and ES generators. Function parameters now follow enum overrides (for example, if function Foo takes enum Bar and enum Bar is overriden to Baz, this change will be reflected on function Foo). Changed default CLGenerator settings to not generate debug helpers. (4 years, 6 months ago) <the_fiddler>
| * 3661428  Added PreviousName property. Moved value parsing to the Name property instead of implementing in each and every ISpecReader. (4 years, 6 months ago) <the_fiddler>
| * d51daef  Improved handling of multiple indirection (pointer-to-pointer, pointer-to-array or any other combination up to 4 levels of indirection). Made the generation of debug helpers optional. They are currently specific to OpenTK.Graphics and need more work before they can be used with OpenTK.Compute or OpenTK.Audio. (4 years, 6 months ago) <the_fiddler>

Parameter names ending with "ret" (e.g. errcode_ret) have a flow of "out". Everything else currently has a flow of "in". Fixed conversion of "unsigned [byte|short|int|long]" parameters (they are now converted to [byte|ushort|uint|ulong] respectively). (4 years, 6 months ago) <the_fiddler>
| * a906a70  Merged fix for issue [#1074]: "	X11XrandrDisplayDevice on Xming ---> Argument is out of range." from 0.9.8 branch. (4 years, 6 months ago) <the_fiddler>
